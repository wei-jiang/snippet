to change the hostname permanently, you need to change it in two places:

vi /etc/sysconfig/network
NETWORKING=yes
HOSTNAME=newHostName
and: a good idea if you have any applications that need to resolve the IP of the hostname)

vi /etc/hosts 
127.0.0.1 newHostName
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
and then

 rebooting the system
